Place your login illustration image here as:

This file is referenced by the login page split layout for the left visual panel and as a small logo in the header. Use the provided reference image and save it with the exact filename above.

Notes:
- Recommended size: ~1600x1200 or larger, PNG or JPG.
- Transparent background works fine; the page adds subtle overlays.
- If the image is missing, the UI falls back to gradients with no functional impact.
